Title

Frontend Refactor and Standardization

Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance the frontend system built
with ReactJS (Next.js) by improving component reusability, resolving
TypeScript errors, and ensuring consistent styling across the
application.

Scope

1.  Refactor Frontend Components
    -   Review the existing React/Next.js components.
    -   Refactor to make them modular, reusable, and maintainable.
    -   Establish guidelines for component structure and naming
        conventions.
2.  Fix TypeScript Issues
    -   Identify and resolve existing TypeScript errors and warnings.
    -   Ensure proper type definitions and strict type checking are
        applied across the codebase.
    -   Update configurations to enforce TypeScript best practices.
3.  Unify Styles and Spacing
    -   Audit the current styling and spacing inconsistencies.
    -   Apply a unified design system with consistent spacing,
        typography, and colors.
    -   Ensure alignment with responsive design principles for
        cross-device compatibility.

Deliverables

-   Refactored reusable component library.
-   TypeScript error-free codebase with strict type definitions.
-   Consistent frontend UI with unified spacing and styles.

Success Metrics

-   Zero TypeScript errors in the build pipeline.
-   Reduction of duplicate or redundant components by at least 30%.
-   Verified UI consistency across core pages through QA testing.

Timeline

-   Week 1–2: Component audit and refactor plan.
-   Week 3–4: TypeScript issue resolution and configuration updates.
-   Week 5–6: Style unification and QA validation.
